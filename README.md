# ML Boston Housing Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of the Boston Housing dataset using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand the factors influencing housing prices in Boston and to build predictive models that can estimate the value of a house based on its features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset includes 506 samples with 13 features and a target variable (MEDV), which represents the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and results.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
